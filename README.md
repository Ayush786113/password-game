# Password Game

## FAQ

#### How to play it?

This may not be easy for everyone. The hints on the bottom of the input are clues to the conditions that ypu need to satisfy. Some clues may be confusing but think in higher dimensions. They are like mini puzzles. Use Google or ChatGPT if you cannot figure out the answer.

#### What is the Hall of Fame and how can I get featured there?

Hall of Fame is a place where everyone who successfuly completes the challenge gets featured. After satisfying all the conditions, a button will appear on the screen. You can choose to either opt in or opt out for the Hall of Fame. If you want to be included, click on the button and fill the form and wait. The dialogue will automatically disappear in some time. After that refresh the page. You should see yourself in the Hall of Fame.
